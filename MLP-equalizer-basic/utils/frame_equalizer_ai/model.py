"""Bias-free joint-I/Q neural demapper architectures and CPU training helpers.

The demapper consumes three real features per data subcarrier
(``Re(Y*conj(H))``, ``Im(Y*conj(H))``, ``|H|^2``) and emits one logit per
coded bit.  Every architecture is a bias-free MLP
``3 -> hidden... -> bits`` with ReLU after each hidden layer, chosen so the
exported weights map directly onto the AIE integer pipeline (int8 MACs, acc64,
shifts).  Training is CPU-only and fully deterministic: fixed seeds plus
``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`` keep checkpoints reproducible.

Architectures are selected by name.  The chosen name fixes both the trained
topology here and the matching kernel header under
``kernel/engine/model/``; see :data:`ARCHITECTURES`.
