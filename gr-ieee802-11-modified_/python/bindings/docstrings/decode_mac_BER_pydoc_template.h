 static const char *__doc_gr_ieee802_11_decode_mac_BER = R"doc(
Decode IEEE 802.11 MAC frames and publish comparable coded-bit vectors.

For FCS-valid frames of at least two OFDM symbols, `pre_viterbi` contains
hard-decision coded bits after deinterleaving and `corrected_coded` contains
the Viterbi-decoded bits re-encoded and punctured at the frame's original rate.
Both ports publish `(metadata, u8vector)` pairs with the same bit order and
length: (number of OFDM symbols - 1) * coded bits per OFDM symbol. The final
symbol is omitted to exclude padding bits. The re-encoded tail is reset to
zero because it may start before that symbol. Hamming distance divided by
vector length estimates pre-FEC coded-bit errors. Failed frames produce no
messages; single-symbol frames produce only an `out` PDU. `out` publishes
CRC-valid MAC payload PDUs.
